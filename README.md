## My process

I always like to start off with bare text, images, styling, while mainting a general idea of the structure of the page with divs and such. Once I'm happy with that I move into CSS to begin the majority of the work for the replication process.

### Built with

- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

Before doing this challenge I already had a thorough understanding of styling but I always find some hiccups here and there so this just helped to reinfornce some of that previous learnning.

### Continued development

After finishing this challenge, I realized I could've probably used custom properties to save the colors provided in the style-guide to make the style file more readable and easier to work with. Semantic HTML is always a plus and I could've defineitly utilized that too. Also, I've yet to learn how to make web pages responsive based on viewport sizes but this one turned out just fine thankfully.
